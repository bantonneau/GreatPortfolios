Both these vids are examples of great portfolios

**A 10/10 portfolio would include**

Portfolio

-fully reactive to all screens

-easy to navigate (no gimmicky shit like reveal animations on everything or wacky navigation. make it user friendly and simple

-no dark mode. First person seeing it will be HR, not a dev

Projects

-2 or 3 fully fledged out full stack projects

-set up dummy accounts for recruiters to log into that shows them dummy data (job listings, ect) so they don't have to register

-for ecommerce set up stripe or other checkout/payment api integration
